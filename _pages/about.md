I am currently a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the University of Bristol, working in the area of hardware security and AI security. I previously held postdoctoral positions in leading security groups in Europe. I was a postdoctoral researcher in the System Security Lab at TU Darmstadt, Germany, working with [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/systemsecurity/people_sys/people_details_sys_45184.en.jsp). Before that, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at Radboud University, led by [Prof. Dr. Joan Daemen](https://cs.ru.nl/~joan/) and [Prof. Dr. Dr. Stjepan Picek](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/picek-s). I obtained my Ph.D. from TU Delft, the Netherlands, in 2023, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. ir. Inald Lagendijk](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/r.l.lagendijk/) and [Prof. Dr. Dr. Stjepan Picek](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/picek-s).

My research focuses on AI-augmented physical and micro-architectural hardware security, as well as AI security. I have published in top-tier security and cryptography venues, including USENIX Security, NDSS, ASIACRYPT, TCHES, and TDSC, and received the 2023 Informatics Best PhD Dissertation Award. Several of my works have been referenced in [AIS 46 guidance](https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Zertifizierung/Interpretationen/AIS_46_AI_guide.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=7) by the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), and I have contributed as a main or co-applicant to several EU- and industry-funded projects.

Alongside my academic research, I worked as a Principal Security Evaluator at SGS Brightsight, the Netherlands (2017–2024). In this role, I led or was involved in several CC EAL5+ security evaluations from globally leading IC designers, focusing on their hardware and software implementation security. Additionally, I led R&D initiatives and collaborated with universities worldwide on research and innovation.
